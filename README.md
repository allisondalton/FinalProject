This project examines the energy consumption of 3 Texas cities: San Antonion, Dallas, and Houston. Specifically, data stated how much energy consumption each of these cities used in a 
24 hour time period. To look more closely at this data, this project used a duck curve, which is a curve that resembles a duck. This curve predicts that people
follow a similar energy consumption trend, by not using much energy in the early morning, but using a high amount in the later evening hours. The project uses a curve fit model to 
see if these Texas cities follow this same trend, and what this could mean for energy consumption in the future, as the world looks towards renewable energy alternatives.
